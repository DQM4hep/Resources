Data quality monitoring is the first step to the certification of the recorded data for off-line physics analysis. Dedicated monitoring framework have been developed by many experiments in the last decades and usually rely on the event data model (EDM) of the experiment, leading to a strong dependency on the data format and storage. We present a generic data quality monitoring system, DQM4HEP, that has been developed without any assumption on the EDM. This increases the code maintenance, the portability across different experiments and re-usability for future experiment. 


After introducing the framework architecture and the various tools provided by the software package, various performances such as memory usage, stability and network bandwidth are discussed. An overview of the different experiments using DQM4HEP is given, as well as the foreseen integration in future other experiments. We finally present the ongoing and future software development for DQM4HEP and long term prospects.
