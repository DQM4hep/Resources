Data quality monitoring is the first step to the certification of the recorded data for off-line physics analysis. 
Dedicated monitoring framework have been developed by many experiments in the past and usually rely on the event data 
model (EDM) of the experiment, leading to a strong dependency on the data format and storage. We present here a generic 
data quality monitoring system, DQM4HEP, that has been developed without any assumption on the EDM. This increases the 
code maintenance, the portability across different experiments and re-usability for future experiment.
We present the framework architecture and the various tools provided by the software package as well as various 
performances such as memory usage, stability and network bandwidth. We give an overview of the different experiments 
using DQM4HEP and the foreseen integration in future other experiments. We finally present the ongoing and future 
software development for DQM4HEP and long term prospects.
